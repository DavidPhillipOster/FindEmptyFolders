# FindEmptyFolders
A macOS app, in Objective-C for finding, showing, and deleting empty folders

## Why

Finding empty folders on macOS isn't easy because of the presence of hidden .DS_Store files. 

Folders that contain only empty folders are themselves empty folders.

This program explores a tree of folders given a root folder, and lets you see the empties.
